Hi! I am Archana Swaminathan, a recent graduate from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad, India. I am currently working as a Faculty Research Assistant at the <a href ="https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/"> University of Maryland, College Park </a>, and being mentored by <a href = "https://www.cs.umd.edu/~abhinav/"> Prof. Abhinav Shrivastava</a>. I'm exploring self-supervised learning for many different applications in computer vision as part of my current research.

In the past, I've had experience with working with Deep Learning in many projects, some of which are: 3D vision, human shape and pose estimation, dataset benchmarking, predictive modelling for time series data, image encryption and decryption, compressive image sensing and denoising, semantic segmentation and object recognition. 

I'm very interested in research in the areas of Image Processing and Computer Vision, and wish to explore different applications in these fields as I motivate and prepare myself for a career as a researcher.

In my free time, I like to read books, play badminton and work out. I love travelling and eating different desserts that mostly comprise of chocolate. I can't wait to go exploring once this pandemic is done! 

Feel free to contact me if you'd like to know more about my work!
