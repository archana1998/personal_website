Hi! I am Archana Swaminathan, a final year undergraduate student at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad, India. I am currently working as a Visiting Researcher with the <a href ="https://v-sense.scss.tcd.ie/"> V-SENSE Research Group, Trinity College Dublin </a>, and being mentored by <a href = "https://v-sense.scss.tcd.ie/?profile=prof-aljosa-smolic"> Prof. Aljosa Smolic</a>.
I'm part of a group that is investigating 3D Geometry for Deep Learning, where we focus on applications that extend to Image-based reconstruction, pose estimation and visual computing.  

In the past, I've had experience with working with Deep Learning in many projects, some of which are: predictive modelling for time series data, image encryption and decryption, compressive image sensing and denoising, semantic segmentation and object recognition. 

I'm very interested in research in the areas of Image Processing and Computer Vision, and wish to explore different applications in these fields as I motivate and prepare myself for a career as a researcher.

In my free time, I like to read books, play badminton and work out. I love travelling and eating different desserts that mostly comprise of chocolate. I can't wait to go exploring once this pandemic is done! 

I'm actively looking for Research Assistantship / PhD opportunities starting fall 2021. Do get in touch with me if you're up for a chat!
